          <p class="funParagraph">Though I had lived in Woodbridge for a bit, this house in New Center was the first place that felt like home. The window bench that was perfect for reading but also allowed you to people watch, the original built-ins that surrounded the fireplace. As much as I loved this house, it was the neighborhood that made it magic. Sitting in the backyard and staring up at the Fisher Building. Pallister Street that was turned into a park so it's pedestrian only, preserving the original brick road. The two years that I was in great shape - walking 5 minutes to FitnessWorks and meeting so many friends. Grabbing a coffee at Avalon and spending all of Saturday afternoon in New Center Park. It's also where Nick and I spent the majority of COVID. The horror in March and April of hearing the ambulances 24/7 as they arrived at Henry Ford Hospital, sometimes the medical helicopters waking us at night. With the darkness came the comfort of our elaborate home cooked meals, our regular 40 minute walks up to Boston Edison, and our binge watching of Great British Bakeoff.</p>

          <p class="funParagraph">If Nick hadn't already spent 15+ years in Midtown, I would have stayed for years longer. Were we cramped? Absolutely. Did we have the world at our fingertips? Indeed. At the end of the day, I'm a city person. I love being in walking distance of so many restaurants and shops. Living next to Marcus Market was ridiculously convenient and it provided so many stories - the characters that you would meet there. We were also across from the Bronx. It was glorious going on our daily evening walks during the summer and almost always seeing someone we knew sitting on the patio. After more than a year of limited interaction, there was joy in those random encounters. The people who you weren't close enough to call during COVID but who you still missed.</p>

          <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">We're moving into our first home next week. I'm beyond excited thinking of the lives that we will build there; however, it is also terrifying. I've avoided commitment most of my life but well damn we did the thing and bought a big fancy house. I dream of how we'll furnish and decorate it - even though it seems like a monumental task right now. I'm looking forward to inviting friends over for elaborate dinner parties. Do I know anything about gardening? No but we have a greenhouse! Hopefully we'll figure out how to have great tasting tomatoes year round. I'm also excited about starting a new career that will allow me more flexibility to work from home. I imagine a home office where I can enjoy our balcony and sunroom, where I can take breaks and walk the streets of Sherwood Forest and admire the gorgeous architecture. Who knows what the future holds but I hope it's great.</p>
